# Teascript

A nice and calm dynamically typed programming language. 

It tries to mix the familiarity of Javascript, the simplicity of Python and the ease of use of Lua's C API.

## Building

Teascript doesn't have any external dependencies, you'll need just gcc and make

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RevengerWizard/teascript && cd teascript
make
```

Once it's been compiled, you should now be able to access `tea` within your console. Let's write our simple first program:

```js
print("Hello World!")
```

Now that you've done that, run it using `tea`, followed by the name of the file ending with a `.tea` extension:

```bash
tea hello.tea
```
